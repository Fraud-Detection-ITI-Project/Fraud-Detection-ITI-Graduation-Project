This repository contains the full implementation of a cloud-native, real-time financial fraud detection system built entirely on Amazon Web Services (AWS). The project demonstrates an end-to-end pipeline that ingests, processes, analyzes, and visualizes financial transactions to detect and alert on fraudulent activity in near real-time.

This project was submitted as a capstone for the Information Technology Institute (ITI), Suez Canal Branch.

## üåü Project Overview

Traditional fraud detection systems often rely on batch processing and static rules, making them slow and ineffective against modern, sophisticated fraud schemes. This project addresses these limitations by building a scalable, serverless, and intelligent system capable of detecting fraud within minutes of a transaction occurring.

The pipeline simulates a real-world financial environment, starting with a custom data generator that produces realistic transaction streams. These streams are ingested via a resilient **Apache Kafka** cluster and fed into the AWS ecosystem through **Amazon Kinesis**. Data is then processed by **AWS Glue**, stored in an **Amazon Redshift** data warehouse, and scored by a high-performance **XGBoost** machine learning model.

When fraud is detected, an automated, event-driven workflow orchestrated by **AWS Step Functions** triggers an immediate email alert via **AWS Lambda** and **Amazon SNS**. Finally, a comprehensive **Amazon QuickSight** dashboard provides analysts with actionable insights and visualizations of fraud trends.

## üèóÔ∏è System Architecture

The system is designed as a multi-layered, cloud-native architecture on AWS. Each layer performs a specific function, ensuring modularity, scalability, and maintainability.

![System Architecture Diagram](docs/images/architecture.png)

The data flows through five distinct layers:

1.  **Data Ingestion Layer:** A Python script on an EC2 instance produces synthetic transaction data and publishes it to a self-hosted Kafka cluster. A Kafka consumer forwards these messages to an Amazon Kinesis Data Stream, which reliably delivers them to an S3 data lake via Kinesis Firehose.
2.  **Data Processing Layer:** An AWS Glue ETL job is triggered, reading the raw data from S3, cleaning and transforming it, and loading it into a Redshift data warehouse. A second Glue job then reads the cleaned data, applies feature engineering, and uses a trained XGBoost model to predict fraud, writing the results to a prediction table in Redshift.
3.  **Fraud Alerting Layer:** An AWS Lambda function, orchestrated by Step Functions, regularly queries Redshift for new fraudulent transactions. Upon detection, it sends an alert message to an SNS topic.
4.  **Monitoring Layer:** Amazon CloudWatch automatically collects logs, metrics, and events from all AWS services, providing a centralized hub for operational oversight, debugging, and alarming.
5.  **Insights Layer:** Amazon QuickSight connects directly to the Redshift data warehouse to visualize key metrics, fraud trends, and model performance on an interactive dashboard.

## üé≠ The Synthetic Data Simulator

Since real financial data is sensitive and private, this project utilizes a custom-built data simulator in Python. It generates a large-scale dataset (500,000+ transactions) that mimics the patterns of the Egyptian market.

The simulator uses a **persona-based model** to create temporally consistent behavior for individual customers. It explicitly embeds and labels transactions from several pre-defined fraud personas, including:

- **`FraudPersona_AccountTakeover`**: A single, high-value transaction from a new device/IP.
- **`FraudPersona_CardTesting`**: A rapid burst of very small-value transactions.
- **`FraudPersona_VelocityAttack`**: A series of large-value transactions in a short time.
- **`FraudPersona_ImpossibleTravel`**: A legitimate transaction followed by a fraudulent one from a physically impossible distance away.
- **`FraudPersona_SyntheticIdentity`**: A new persona that makes a few small "warm-up" transactions before a massive cash-out.

---

## ü§ñ Machine Learning Model

The core intelligence of the system is a supervised classification model.

- **Algorithm:** **XGBoost** (Extreme Gradient Boosting) was chosen for its high performance on tabular data, scalability, and built-in handling for imbalanced datasets.
- **Feature Engineering:** Features were engineered to capture complex behavioral patterns, such as `txn_per_hour`, `distance_to_merchant`, `is_far_txn`, and binary flags for high-risk events.
- **Performance:** The model was evaluated on a holdout test set with excellent results, proving its effectiveness.
  - **F1 Score:** **90.32%**
  - **Recall:** **97.50%** (Catches 97.5% of all true fraud)
  - **Precision:** **84.12%** (Over 84% of alerts are for true fraud)
  - **AUC:** **1.00**

## üö® Alerting and Automation

The alerting workflow is fully automated using a combination of serverless AWS services.

![State Machine Workflow](docs/images/step_function_workflow.png)

1.  **Orchestration:** An **AWS Step Functions** state machine orchestrates the entire process, running the Glue jobs in sequence.
2.  **Detection:** After the ML job, a polling loop is initiated. An **AWS Lambda** function queries the Redshift `predicted_fraud` table every 10 seconds for new entries that have not yet been alerted on.
3.  **Notification:** If new fraudulent transactions are found, the Lambda function formats an HTML email alert and publishes it to an **Amazon SNS** topic.
4.  **Delivery:** **Amazon SES** (Simple Email Service) is subscribed to the SNS topic and delivers the email to the fraud analysis team. The system then updates the database to prevent duplicate alerts.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Limitations

- **Synthetic Data:** The model's performance is based on a synthetic dataset. While realistic, it cannot capture the full complexity and noise of real-world data. Performance in a live production environment may differ.
- **Near Real-Time vs. True Real-Time:** The architecture's latency is measured in minutes due to the batching nature of Kinesis Firehose and AWS Glue. It is designed for rapid investigation, not for instantaneous transaction blocking.
- **Static Model:** The model is static and does not automatically retrain. In a real-world scenario, this could lead to performance degradation over time as fraud patterns evolve (concept drift).

---

## üîÆ Future Enhancements

- **True Real-Time Inference:** Replace the Glue inference job with a streaming solution using **Kinesis Data Analytics** or **AWS Lambda** to score transactions in sub-seconds.
- **Automated MLOps Pipeline:** Implement a full MLOps pipeline using **Amazon SageMaker** to automate model retraining, evaluation, and deployment, combating concept drift.
- **Integrate Model Explainability (XAI):** Use libraries like **SHAP** to provide explanations for each fraud prediction, assisting analysts in their investigations.
- **Unsupervised Anomaly Detection:** Add an unsupervised model (e.g., Isolation Forest) to the pipeline to detect novel and previously unseen fraud patterns.
